\usage{
plot_rain_flow(id = NULL, rain = NULL, flow = NULL, area = NULL,
  title = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Station identification number}

\item{rain}{Rainfall time series, measured in mm/month}

\item{flow}{Flow time series, measured in m3/s}

\item{area}{Catchment area in Km2}

\item{title}{(optional) Plot title}
}
\value{
Plot rainfall and flow for a given station
}
\description{
This function retrieves rainfall and flow time series for a given catchment, divides the flow by the catchment area and converts it to mm/day to that it can be comparable with the rainfall (mm/month). Finally it generates a plots combining rainfall and flow information.
