#' Calculate seasonal averages
#'
#' @description This calculates the seasonal averages from a time series.
#'
#' @param timeseries Time series (xts class).
#' @param season Name of the season (Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer)
#' @param startseason String encoding the start of the season (e.g. for spring
#' in the northen hemisphere this is "03-21")
#' @param endseason String encoding the end of the season (e.g. for spring in
#' the northen emisphere this is "06-20")
#' @param parallel Logical, FALSE by default. If parallel = TRUE means that the
#' function can be used in parallel computations.
#'
#' @return A vector containing the seasonal average and significance level
#' (p-value) for each time series.
